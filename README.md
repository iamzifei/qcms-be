## Tech stack

- `graphql-yoga` for Graphql middleware for NodeJS, `graphql-yoga` is based on `Express`

## Test

In this case, since we only return a static JSON data, plus the time limitation, I haven't put any tests. In practice, unit testing should be there.

Also eslint check, etc should be applied wherever possible

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the service.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to verify the service is up and verify the Graphql queries.
